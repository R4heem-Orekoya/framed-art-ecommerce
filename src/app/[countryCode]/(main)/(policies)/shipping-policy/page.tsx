                  We offer shipping to the USA and Nigeria. Shipping charges 
                  for your order will be calculated and displayed 
                  at checkout. We offer international shipping, so rates will be 
                  location dependant, but usually range from $5 for small 
                  posters to $20 for large ready-to-hang framed 
                  posters. Note that these are only an example. Final 
                  charges will be calculated during checkout. For orders of 
                  multiple items.
